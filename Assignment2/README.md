# Assignment 2!

Create  a  simple  PHP  /  MySQL  based  **acceleration  calculator**  on  the  specification  given  on  page: [https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/acceleration](https://www.omnicalculator.com/physics/acceleration)
You  need  to  use  all  the  three  aspects  while  calculating  acceleration:  (1)  speed  difference,  (2)  distance  traveled,  (3)  and Net  force,  as  given  in  the  drop-down.


## Instructions:

User can also select the units of each text-box while calculating acceleration. For example, initial speed and final speed units.
Similarly  check  units  of  all  text  boxes  yourself:  initial  speed,  final  speed,  Time,  Distance,  Mass, Net  force  and  Acceleration.  Each  unit  details  in  the  drop-down  must  be  saved  in  MySQL database  and  must  be  fetched  from  there  while  you  are  applying  the  calculation.  All  the  help and  documentation  of  formulas  and  theory  regarding  acceleration  calculator  is  already  given.

Students  have  to  create  **very  cool  looking** web  pages.  All  calculations  must  be  in  PHP only,  don’t  use  online  JavaScript  code  or  API  for  acceleration  calculations  or  unit  conversions. JavaScript  /  HTML5  can  be  used  for  front  end  development  only  don’t  use  any  third  part  library or  any  web  site  generator.  You  need  to  host  your  acceleration  calculator  in  the  free  hosting.
