        <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
      <ul class="procoll"> 
        <li class="procol2">Game Theory– </li>
        <p class="colpara">Assembled and remodeled a C code to evaluate the application of GAME THEORY in Computer<br> Science. The complex interaction between the players was justified by the application of a<br> simple problem of optimal tape storage (Scheduling). </p>
        <li class="procol2">Object Oriented Programming –Food Management System in C++ </li>
        <p class="colpara">An online food ordering system enriched with the concepts of Objected Oriented Programming.<br> Integrated simulations to verify the strengthening of the OOP concepts and functionalities like<br> encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, relationships, virtual function, exception handling<br> and also used vectors to store data from file (vector).  </p>
        <li class="procol2">Intelligent Quotient (IQ) tester (Assembly Language)</li>
        <p class="colpara">Facilitated the design of the series of exercises/questions (Different mathematical patterns and <br>sequences) in an attempt to measure intelligence. Built in sophisticated features like random<br> number generator were employed during the course of logic building. </p>
        <li class="procol2">Data Structures–Implementation and Analysis of Scapegoat tree</li>
        <p class="colpara">Exploited the efficiency of the Scapegoat tree in searching and<br> insertion operations. Time and Amortized analysis was performed in the form of graphs and tables after the final execution.</p>
        <li class="procol2">Data base and OOAD- Hotel Management System-Web Application </li>
        <p>My goal was to demonstrate how data in hotels is managed. Handling and identifying the objects<br> from the information and converting them in the form of efficient and insightful modules was the<br>key. This then ultimately got mapped on the database which was aimed for everyone and not<br> just the spearheads of the hotel</p>
        <li class="procol2">Block-Trade: Smart and Secure Trading of Assets Using Block Chain </li>
         <p class="colpara">Extends the idea of public ledger in a more transparent way not only in real estate but also in <br>trading of electronics and vehicles. Implements block Chain to track the asset without relying on<br> traditional ledger through our platform.</p>
