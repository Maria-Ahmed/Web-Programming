        <h2> My Working Ethics</h2>
            <p> I try to read at least 2 articles. I really like seeing things from a different perspective. The articles can be about anything: how to solve a certain coding problem,<br> why JavaScript sucks sometimes, or what the coolest new technologies are. 
                It’s important to not get stuck in a certain mindset! </p>

            <p>I try to solve at least 5 CodeWars Kata. CodeWars is your best friend when you just get into coding, but also when you’ve been coding for many decades!<br> 
                The solutions to the problems they give you are often very useful, as you will learn to improve your syntax a lot by just scrolling through the solutions that other people gave</p>
            
            <p>
                I try to watch online coding courses for at least 2 hours per day. I love watching online courses, because I always learn new things and get inspired by seeing the instructor writing the code with such ease.<br>
                 I try to give my own twist to it by working on a similar project on the side, just slightly different, so I’m not simply copying what the instructor is doing. Also, it’s perfect<br> when you just don’t want to get out of bed and still feel like you’ve been productive ;)

        <h2> My motivational qoutes</h2>

            <p>"I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have"</p>
            <p>“ Work to become, not to acquire."</p>
            <p> “ Find out what you like doing best and get someone to pay you for doing it</p>
