    <h1>INTRODUCTION/Description:</h1>
    <p>
        The rapid growth of photo-sharing apps like Instagram has influenced a lot of entrepreneurs and startups to develop their own custom Instagram clone app,<br>letting people share pictures and videos publicly. 
        We're going to be building the backend service of an Instagram <br>like project and figure out how we work with the data, and make API endpoints.
